Our project sought to incorporate Emojis, a new component of modern electronic communication, into these systems of classification and association.  \r\nPlease download our Paper to learn more about project!\r\n\r\n## **Data Collection Results**\r\n\r\n## ![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0752.png)\r\n1. \"Since I Met You Baby\" by Kenny Neal\r\n2. \"Just a Little Bit of You\" by Michael Jackson\r\n3. \"If I Ain't Got You\" by Alicia Keys\r\n4. \"Forever\" by Chris Brown\r\n5. \"She Will Be Loved\" by Maroon 5\r\n6. \"Let's Make Love (Album)\" by Faith Hill\r\n7. \"Shape Of My Heart\" by Backstreet Boys\r\n8. \"Fall In Love (Rub A Dub Mix)\" by John Legend\r\n9. \"My Baby\" by Janet Jackson\r\n10. \"Piece of My Heart\" by Janis Joplin\r\n11. \"Raining On Our Love\" by Shania Twain - UNCLEAR (10/9/1/0)\r\n12. \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" by The Shirelles\r\n13. \"Permanent Lonely\" by Billie Jo Spears\r\n14. \"Don't Worry Baby\" by Bryan Ferry\r\n15. \"Be With Me\" by Mindy McCready\r\n16. \"I Only Have Eyes For You\" by John Stevens\r\n17. \"Don't Go Away\" by Oasis - UNCLEAR (7/6/1/6)\r\n\r\n## ![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0767.png)\r\n1. \"Fake Plastic Trees (Acoustic)\" by Radiohead\r\n2. \"Karma\" by Alicia Keys\r\n3. \"Paralyzed\" by The Cardigans - UNCLEAR (6/7/5/2)\r\n4. \"Soot and Stars\" by The Smashing Pumpkins\r\n5. \"Losin' End (LP Version)\" by Michael McDonald\r\n6. \"Beautiful\" by Eminem\r\n\r\n## ![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0766.png)\r\n1. \"Heart-Shaped Box\" by Nirvana - UNCLEAR (5/4/8/3)\r\n2. \"Spin (Album Version)\" by Taking Back Sunday\r\n3. \"Metal\" by Nine Inch Nails\r\n4. \"Slaughter The Gods\" by The Accursed\r\n5. \"The Heretic Anthem (Live)\" by Slipknot\r\n6. \"Bite Back\" by The All-American Rejects - UNCLEAR (2/5/7/6)\r\n7. \"4 Words (To Choke Upon)\" by Bullet For My Valentine\r\n8. \"Lesson Learned\" by Alice In Chains\r\n\r\n## ![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0874.png)\r\n1. \"Let's Get It Started\" by Black Eyed Peas\r\n2. \"Touch The Sky\" by Kanye West\r\n3. \"Don't Stop The Music\" by Rihanna\r\n4. \"Into The Groove\" by Madonna\r\n5. \"Change Clothes\" by Jay-Z\r\n6. \"Hips Don't Lie\" by Shakira - UNCLEAR (9/0/2/9)\r\n7. \"Poker Face\" by Lady Gaga\r\n8. \"Lively Up Yourself\" by Bob Marley\r\n9. \"Heaven's In New York\" by Wyclef Jean\r\n\r\n## **Classification Examples**\r\n### **A Clear Classification**\r\n####[\"Let's Make Love\" by Faith Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3OSVX7J78)  \r\nClassification: 19 - 1 - 0 - 0  \r\n![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0752.png)  \r\nThis results of this classification were expected and displayed a clear association with listeners and the above Emoji.\r\n\r\n### **An Unclear Classification**\r\n####[\"Raining On Our Love\" by Shania Twain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tKb_fj2rOI)  \r\nClassification: 10 - 9 - 1 - 0  \r\n![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0752.png) OR ![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0767.png)  \r\nThis classification was unclear as it was nearly evenly split between the two Emojis above--ten out of twenty manual classifications pointed to the former and nine out of the twenty pointed to the latter. We did anticipate this divide as the themes of the song are both love and sadness. However, this provides a clear example of two things: First, the music is subjective, as some can listen to a song and associate with one thing while another person can associate said song with something entirely different. Second, music is multidimensional and can represent multiple things at one time.  \r\n\r\n### **An Unexpected Classification**\r\n####[\"Piece Of My Heart\" by Janis Joplin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8PGDlh6GfM)  \r\nClassification: 11 - 3 - 5 - 1  \r\nExpected:  \r\n![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0767.png) OR ![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0766.png)  \r\nData Results:  \r\n![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0752.png)  \r\nWe were surprised by this classification. While we did expect that this song could have different Emoji associations for different people, we anticipated that there would be a strong association by participants with the two expected Emoji. However, most people actually associated this song with the heart-eyes Emoji.  \r\nWhile we anticipated the upset tone of the lyrics and vocals to dominate for listeners and lead them to choose our expected Emojis, this was not the case. While eight total listeners did behave as anticipated and choose one of the two Emojis we expected, the majority (11) chose the heart-eyes Emoji. One possible explanation for this is that while the song does focus on a theme of being upset, it is about a former lover and, thus, may have swayed listeners to classify it with the heart-eyes Emoji.  \r\nSimilar to the \"Unclear Classification\" example above, this data exemplifies the subjectivity of music in that different people perceive different things when listening to the same music. Furthermore, its wide distribution of \"votes\" across the four Emojis also point to the multidimensionality of music in that music can represent multiple themes concurrently.\r\n\r\n## **Suggested Songs**\r\n![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0752.png)  \r\n[\"One Fine Day\" by The Chiffons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1uObmcQQI4) \r\n\r\n![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0767.png)  \r\n[\"Angeles\" by Elliott Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psLhTyj1sAY)\r\n\r\n![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0766.png)  \r\n[\"The Plot To Bomb The Panhandle\" by A Day To Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1MujfQqLIg)  \r\n\r\n![](http://pix.iemoji.com/sbemojix2/0874.png)\r\n[\"London Bridge\" by Fergie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQBx4PFfzxk)    \r\n[\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\" by Beyonce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY) \r\n***\r\n###A Project by Randall Harris and Samantha Trippy  \r\nNorthwestern University - Winter 2015  \r\nProfessor Bryan Pardo - EECS 352: Machine Perception of Music and Audio  \r\nContact Info:  \r\n[Randall Harris](mailto:RandallHarris2017@u.northwestern.edu)  \r\n[Samantha Trippy](mailto:SamanthaTrippy2016@u.northwestern.edu)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
